## Bloccit

Bloccit is a Node.js app where users can create topics, posts, and comments. Users can also upvote/downvote and favorite posts.

I created this as part of www.bloc.io 's web development curriculum.

It features Express as the server framework, EJS and Bootstrap for views, Sequelize for ORM, and Jasmine testing.

You can see the live app at https://jennjwill-bloccit.herokuapp.com/
